Engage in structured chain-of-thought reasoning with adaptive focus modes and context awareness.

**Focus Modes:**
- 🔬 **logic**: Technical work (algorithms, backend). Strict, fact-based.
- 🎨 **vibe**: Creative work (UI, design). Exploratory, intuitive.
- 🐛 **debug**: Error investigation. Systematic analysis.
- 🔒 **security**: Auth, encryption, attack vectors. Paranoid validation.
- ⚡ **performance**: Optimization, profiling. Measure before optimizing.
- ♿ **accessibility**: WCAG compliance, screen readers. Inclusive design.

**Stages:** problem_analysis → solution_design → implementation → verification → exploration → debugging

**Context Features:**
- Use `previous_summary` to maintain reasoning continuity across thoughts.
- Use `design_tokens` (colors, fonts, mood) for consistent visual decisions in vibe mode.

Set nextThoughtNeeded to false when complete, or adjust total_thoughts to extend reasoning.
